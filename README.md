1.  Fork this repository to your own Github account.
2.  Clone down the forked repo from your Github account to your local development environment.
3.  In the project directory on your local machine, install all the npm modules with `npm install`.
4.  Your answers should go in the `exercises.js` file.
5.  After you are done with each function, check if the tests pass by entering `npm test` in the terminal.
